    <h1>A snarky conversation with Javascript</h1>
    <b></em><h3>Act 1</h3></b>
    <h5>Scene 1</h5>
    <p>Male 1: <span class ='name'id = 'within'></span><span>, meet Javascript</span></p>
    <p><span class = 'name'></span>: Hello Java, it's nice to make your acquaintance</p>
    <p>Male 1: What did <em>you</em> call him?</p>
    <p><span class = 'name'></span> : ermm, well I just called him Java. I figured we're going to spending a lot of time together. But maybe that was too soon to introduce a nickname. </p>
    <p>Java: Did someone say my name?</p>
    <p>Male 1: Look what you did, <span class='name'id = 'within'>. Didn't your teacher tell you? Ham doesn't come from hamsters. There's no relation. Except that I did once have a hamster who loved a good pork leg. But that's neither here nor there! </span></p>
    <h5>Scene 2</h5>
    <p>Javascript: What's your name? </p>
    <p><span class = 'name'></span>: <span class = 'name'></span>
    <p>Javascript: What's your favorite food?</p>
    <span class = 'name'></span><span>: My favorite food is </span><span class = 'food1'></span>
    <p>Javascript: So, your favorite food is <span class = 'food1'></span>. </p>
    <p><span class = 'name'></span>: <span id = 'confirm'></span></p>
    <h5>Scene 3</h5>
    <p id = 'directions' >[This is where the play becomes gamified. If <span class='name'></span> agrees that their favorite food is <span class = 'food1'></span> then Javascript wins. If not, the game goes on.]</p>
    <p>Javascript: I can play this game. Humans change their mind. I am programmed with conditionals. What is your favorite food now?</p>
    <p><span class = 'name'></span>: Ok, Java. I mean Jabba. I mean Javascript, my favorite food is, at the moment, <span id = 'food2'></span>.</p>
    <p>Javascript: Very funny. Let's get some java with Java at Mos Eisley Cantina.</p>
